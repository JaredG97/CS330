How do I approach designing software?
I typically begin by visualizing the end result and working backwards mentally for each function of the program.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Honestly, working with a tool I've never touched before and getting to grips with it. Part of computer science is personal growth and evoltution, 
and being able to adapt to new concepts is important.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
One object at a time was how I took it. I sketched my scene out on paper and worked through each object individually.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Very easy to see how modular programming can be accomplished using the mindset I had throughout this course.

How do I approach developing programs?
Logically, and with lots of information. Taking into account what you're making and who you're making it for dictates what you're going to have to write.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Having to think of real-world objects as multiple pieces. The pen I made was a good example of this for me.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Creating the same object multiple times and positioning it until I got it the way I needed it to be was all part of this.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Yes, it's taught me to be a better reader and to really understand what a codebase is going to do before I fiddle and ask questions.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
By allowing me to provide for my family and be a contributing member of society.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Opened my eyes to the world of 3D modeling, but I don't think I have enough experience with the tools yet to make any concrete decisions. Game design may be on the table, but I'm unsure.
